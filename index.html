                         <p>My name is Facundo Luciano Rodriguez and this is my basic portolio! I was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina and moved to the United States when I was nine years old. My culture is very important to me and I wouldn't change it for anything. Since growing up in the states, my experiences have molded me into the person I am today.</p>
                         <br>
                         <p> Moving to the US gave me new opportunities to experience and learn many different things. From elementary school through to college, I tended to guide my self through sports and art, so much so that I was able to afford college on academic and sports scholarships. Now that I've been off from school for a few years, I'm excited to tackle this new challange and be able to grow and better my life.</p> 
                         <br>
                         <p> In the past I've had just about all types of jobs, from construction, to service industry, to health care, but none of which made me really happy or much money. With this program I'm ready for a job that will compliment my life and boost my life. When I'm not working, I like to play soccer, do ceramics, and also watch movies or games with my wife and dogs. I'm looking forward to learning all that I can from this bootcamp to enrich my life and open more doors to a better career. </p>
